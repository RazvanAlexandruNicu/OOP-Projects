This program simulates a Shell Filesystem using a hierarchical organization of the files,
implemented using different Design Patterns such as Command, Composite, AbstractFactory and Singleton.
The program takes 3 params:
	- the input file path name
	- the output file path name
	- the error file path name
It supports commands such as:
	- ls (-R)
	- mkdir
 	- touch
	- rm
	- pwd
	- mv
	- cp
	- cd
The errors generated by misusing the commands can be found in the error output file.
